# Covid-19 Analysis
Covid-19 Data Analysis using Python

# Introduction:

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, affecting millions of lives and economies across the globe. Understanding the factors that contribute to the spread of the virus is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate its impact. This analysis aims to explore the relationship between COVID-19 infection rates and various socio-economic factors, using a combination of datasets on confirmed COVID-19 cases and World Happiness Report indicators.

# Outline of Analysis:

## Data Import and Cleaning:
  - Importing necessary Python modules for data analysis.
  - Loading the COVID-19 confirmed cases dataset.
  - Cleaning and organizing the dataset by removing unnecessary columns.

## Data Aggregation:
  - Aggregating the COVID-19 dataset to sum the confirmed cases by country.
  - Investigating the dataset's structure and dimensions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Visualizing the infection rates for specific countries like China, Italy, and Spain.
  - Calculating and analyzing the maximum infection rates for these countries.
  - Utilizing a for loop to find the maximum infection rate for all countries.

## Merging Datasets:
  - Importing and cleaning the World Happiness Report dataset.
  - Merging the COVID-19 infection data with the World Happiness Report data.

## Correlation Analysis:
  - Calculating the correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.
  - Examining the correlation between COVID-19 infection rates and socio-economic factors.

## Visualization:
  - Visualizing the relationship between GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, and maximum infection rates.

## Further Analysis:
  - Considering the impact of COVID-19 deaths to validate initial findings.
  - Importing and exploring the COVID-19 deaths dataset.
  - Analyzing the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and socio-economic factors.

## Conclusion:
  - Summarizing key findings and insights from the analysis.
  - Reflecting on the implications of the relationship between socio-economic factors and COVID-19 infection rates.
